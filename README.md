# ScoresMatter
A Performance Matters hack designed to show test passwords and answers. Currently, the hack can show test passwords and the questions you've got right/wrong (without actually submitting the test).

Source code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for Performance Matters to patch the hack. But you know what? Instead of trying to patch every method of cheating, just rebuild the education system from the ground up!


<h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
* To run, log in to Performance Matters. 

* Do Ctrl+Shift+J (or right-click and hit Inspect Element, and click Console on the top).

* Copy all the code in the <a href="https://github.com/theplummer/ScoresMatter/blob/main/ScoresMatter.js">ScoresMatter.js</a> file.

* Then paste the code you copied in the console, then press enter. Voila! The hack has been activated!

You can press the following keys (they work like Ctrl commands; you MUST hold each preceding key in combination with the next one):
* "[", "]", "\": This disables the hack. You can do it again to re-enable it.
* "'", ";", ".", ",": This shows any errors that may have happened in the program. This can be useful if you want to report an issue about the program here on the GitHub repository.
* ",", ".", ";": This gives you the answers in a dirtier format (popup box), but is more reliable and less prone to error (the default way the program does this is it puts a check mark or an X in the question selection box).
